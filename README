1. Compilation and installation

Build system is waf based (http://code.google.com/p/waf/).

To build the plugin, use:

  ./waf configure
  ./waf build

You might use ./waf install to copy the resulting .so file into
your ~/.purple/plugins dir or copy it yourself whereever you want.

2. Usage

As soon as you enable the plugin in pidgin plugins dialog, it starts to
hide menus for conversation windows. The following shortcuts will be working:

 - ctrl-i -- shows info about current user you're talking with
 - ctrl-n/ctrl-p -- go to next/prev tab, tab cycling is enabled, i.e.
                    if you press ctrl-n at the last tab, you'll switch to
                    the first one
 - Esc -- switch to command mode

In command mode the following commands are available:
 - i -- go to insert (normal) mode
 - gt/gT -- go to next/prev tab
 - g^/g$ -- go to first/last tab
 - d -- close current tab
 - u -- undo close tab

Feedback and ideas are welcome,
